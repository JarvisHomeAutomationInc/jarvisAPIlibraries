# jarvisAPIlibraries


## Description
This is used for 3rd party developers to integrate the Jarvis Home API Cloud Services into a developers personal project. Since the API usage cost is calculated by each API call
it would not mean the developer would have endless usage of our API, they would have to sign up for a paid account. 

## Support

- C#/.NET 7.0 -> Allows the developer to use the API for their asp.net web appplication or for a desktop console/form application.
- JavaScript/node -> This would allow for any backend Javascript developers to use our API's with nodejs

## Work In Progress
- python support
- Java Support
- Go Support
- Rust Support
- C++ Support
